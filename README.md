# SDDC-Certificate-Expiration

Use the following simple command to pull your VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC certiicate start and end dates. A couple things to keep in mind:
1 - Script MUST be run via Linux VM
2 - Ensure Linux VM can ping VMC SDDC vCenter
3 - You should be able to use fqdn or IP to get certificate expiry information
